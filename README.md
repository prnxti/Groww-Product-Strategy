# Groww-Product-Strategy

This project presents a comprehensive product strategy and feature design proposal for Groww, a leading digital investment platform in India. The initiative focuses on introducing social investment features to enhance user engagement, foster financial literacy, and build a collaborative investing community.

Assessed current trends in digital investments and identified growth opportunities aligned with evolving user behavior and technological adoption. Also designed user personas to guide design decisions and ensure alignment with real user needs and pain points.



Feature Ideation & Design
Designed three strategic features to drive engagement and community building:

- Groww Folio – Portfolio sharing and comparison

- Groww Connect – Social investing via chats, forums, and investment clubs

- Groww Quest – Gamified learning with challenges and rewards

Created high-level wireframes illustrating the integration of new features within the existing platform architecture, with a focus on simplicity and usability.

Outlined a three-phase GTM plan including pre-launch user testing, strategic partnerships, and performance evaluation through user feedback and A/B testing.
